Cup, reports of exploitation and labour abuse have consistently tarnished
preparations, with workers exposed to forced labour, unpaid wages and
excessive working hours.
So, it was with great anticipation that Qatar announced in 2017 a partnership
with the International Labour Organization to bring its labour laws and
practices in line with international standards, offering the possibility that the
World Cup could instead leave a positive legacy for workers’ rights.
This report highlights that Qatar has made some important progress to
date, including major reforms announced in 2020 to facilitate freedom of
movement and introduce a new minimum wage. Yet, it also demonstrates
that the weak implementation and enforcement of other reforms introduced
in recent years has left thousands of workers at the mercy of unscrupulous
employers who have been allowed to commit abuses with impunity.
Qatar has a major opportunity to prove to the world that it is serious about
workers’ rights. As the countdown to kick off continues, will the promises of
labour reforms be matched by the reality faced by the migrant workers upon
whom Qatar so depends? "</p>
